## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the **Python Basics** module. This directory serves as the foundational pillar for the **AI-ML Prerequisites** roadmap. 

Before diving into complex algorithms and neural networks, a solid grasp of Python syntax, data structures, and control flow is essential. These scripts cover the core concepts required to manipulate data effectively.

## 📂 Code Dictionary

The scripts are organized by concept. Below is a breakdown of what each file demonstrates:

### 1. Core Syntax & Operations
| File Name | Description | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `variable.py` | Introduction to storing data. | Variable assignment, naming conventions. |
| `typecasting.py` | Converting between data types. | `int()`, `str()`, `float()`. |
| `user_input.py` | Handling dynamic user interaction. | `input()` function. |
| `arithmetic.py` | Mathematical computations. | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulus). |
| `main.py` | Main entry point script. | Script execution flow. |

### 2. Control Flow & Logic
| File Name | Description | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `if_statements.py` | Conditional decision making. | `if`, `elif`, `else`. |
| `logical_operators.py` | Combining conditional logic. | `and`, `or`, `not`. |
| `for_loop.py` | Iterating over sequences. | Definite iteration, ranges. |
| `while_loops.py` | Iterating based on conditions. | Indefinite iteration. |

### 3. Data Structures
| File Name | Description | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lists.py` | Mutable sequences of items. | Indexing, slicing, appending. |
| `tuple.py` | Immutable sequences. | Fixed data collections. |
| `Set.py` | Unordered collections of unique elements. | Deduplication, set operations. |

### 4. Mini-Projects
| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `count_down_timer.py` | A simple logic application using loops and the `time` module to create a countdown. |

## 🚀 How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed. You can run any of these scripts individually via the terminal:

```bash
# Example: Running the List demonstration
python lists.py

# Example: Running the Countdown Timer
python count_down_timer.py
